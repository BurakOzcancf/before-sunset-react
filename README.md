## Overview

### Backstory?

The user is a book collector, especially into < your favorite author here > 's books and wants to list all his/her books by latest publish year so she'll know where to look. This super-productive author started writing many years ago, wrote for more than 60 years, and published more than 100's of books. We need this kanban to be rock-solid.
